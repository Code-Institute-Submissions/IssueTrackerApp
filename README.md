# ISSUE TRACKER
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tjasajan/IssueTrackerApp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tjasajan/IssueTrackerApp)

The primary entity in the Issue Tracker is a ticket describing a userâ€™s issue, with ticket status.

Users can create tickets, comment on tickets, upvote bugs and upvote feature requests. 

Upvoting bugs is free. To upvote a feature request, users need to pay some money.
